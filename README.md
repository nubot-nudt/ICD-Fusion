# 1. üõ∞Ô∏èIntroduction
This repository introduces our work "Efficient Multi-Modal 3D Object Detector via Instance Level Contrastive Distillation"

# 2. Instance-level Contrastive Distillation Framework (ICD)
## 2.1 The Overall of ICD
We propose a novel Instance-level Contrastive Distillation framework for 3D object detection. Our framework achieves efficient knowledge distillation from single-modal to multimodal 3D detectors and incorporates object-aware contrastive learning to enable fine-grained modality alignment within the unified BEV space.
